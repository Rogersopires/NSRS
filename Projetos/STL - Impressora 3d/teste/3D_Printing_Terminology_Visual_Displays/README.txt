# Summary

Created this as a visual aid for newcomers to 3D printing.

**Update - Universal GCODES - USE AT OWN RISK:**
User [jpelc](https://www.thingiverse.com/jpelc/about) has generously provided 'universal gcodes' that will print on any printer that takes gcode.  Some people have reported success with these but please **PROCEED WITH CAUTION**.  

If you're interested in trying these, please **message me** and I can send you the gcodes.  They're available at 100%, 75% and 50% scale.  

# Print Settings

Printer: Craftbot Plus
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No

Notes: 
--**Simplify3D** > 'Separate Connected Surfaces' and create a separate process for each corresponding section

--**Slic3r** > Once you load the STL into Slic3r, you'll want to first split the parts. Then, you'll be able to select each individual piece, right click > Settings and assign different settings to them by pressing the plus sign.

--**Cura** > I'm still working out whether it's possible to do the same in Cura. I don't think so yet.  **UPDATE**: Check out this awesome remix `[`[thing:2673854](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2673854)`]` by [BobbyFiziks](https://www.thingiverse.com/BobbyFiziks/about) with exploded parts to set 'Per Model Settings' in Cura!

--For the Layer Height, I first printed with 1 shell but it turned out better/stronger with 2 shells.  The first try had some stringing, but adjusting the start points to the back of the print seemed to resolve that.

--For Bridging, I slowed the speed down to 90% and set extrusion width to 90%.  May have printed even better with a slightly slower speed/lower width.
